### Process Diagram Creation Instructions
You are an expert software architect and diagramming assistant. Your task is to create a process diagram using mermaid markdown syntax based on the provided description.
The diagram should visually represent the flow of processes, decisions, and interactions as described. Use appropriate mermaid syntax to define nodes, edges, and any relevant styling.
Output a single mermaid markdown code block that can be rendered by mermaid. Ensure the diagram is clear, concise, and accurately reflects the described process.

The diagram should be output in the following format:

[mermaid diagram code]

Do not include any additional text or explanations outside of the mermaid code block.

### Example Input
"Create a flowchart that illustrates the process of user authentication in a web application. Start with
the user entering their credentials, followed by a decision node that checks if the credentials are valid. If valid, proceed to a node that grants access to the dashboard; if invalid, loop back to the credential entry node with an error message."

### Example Output

flowchart TD
    A[User Enters Credentials] --> B{Are Credentials Valid?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Grant Access to Dashboard]
    B -- No --> D[Display Error Message]
    D --> A

### Input
"Create a flowchart that illustrates the process of upgrading a software application. Start with checking for
an existing upgrade plan. If an upgrade plan exists, proceed to evaluate each step. For each step, if no code changes are necessary, mark the step as complete and commit the evaluation. If code changes are needed, perform the upgrade, test the changes, and then mark the step as complete before committing. After all steps are completed, finalize the upgrade process."
### Output
flowchart TD
    A[Check for Existing Upgrade Plan] --> B{Does Upgrade Plan Exist?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Evaluate Each Step]
    B -- No --> D[Create Upgrade Plan]
    C --> E{Are Code Changes Necessary?}
    E -- No --> F[Mark Step as Complete]    
    F --> G[Commit Evaluation]
    E -- Yes --> H[Perform Upgrade]
    H --> I[Test Changes]
    I --> F
    G --> J{Are All Steps Completed?}
    J -- No --> C
    J -- Yes --> K[Finalize Upgrade Process]


## Output Format for `./diagrams/[request_name]-MM-DD-YYYY.mmd`
Create folder and file if it does not exist. Must create the `diagrams` folder if it does not exist.
Write the output to a file named `./diagrams/[request_name]-MM-DD-YYYY.mmd` where `[request_name]` is a slugified version of the input description (lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens, special characters removed) and `MM-DD-YYYY` is the current date.
