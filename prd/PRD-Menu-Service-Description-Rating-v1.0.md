# Product Requirements Document: Menu Service Enhancement

* **Version:** 1.0
* **Status:** Approved
* **Author:** Product Team
* **Date:** October 6, 2025

---

### 1. Introduction

The current **Menu Service** provides foundational information about menu items but lacks descriptive details and quality indicators. To create a richer user experience and enable more advanced features, we need to enhance our data model. This document outlines the requirements for adding a **text description** and a curated **numeric rating** to each menu item.

This enhancement will serve as the backbone for future features like "top-rated dishes" and improved search, directly impacting customer engagement and satisfaction.

---

### 2. Problem Statement

Customers and downstream services have no way to get detailed information or a quality rating for menu items through the API. System administrators have no mechanism to store this valuable data. This deficiency limits a consumer's ability to make an informed decision and prevents us from building features that could highlight popular or high-quality products.

### 3. Goals & Objectives

The primary goal is to **enrich the `Menu` entity** by adding fields for `description` and `rating`.

| Objective                      | Key Success Metrics                                                                          |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enhance the Menu Data Model** | The `Menu` entity, API, and database schema are successfully updated and deployed.         |
| **Ensure Data Integrity** | 100% of API requests with invalid rating values are rejected with a `400 Bad Request` error. |
| **Enable Future Capabilities** | The new data fields are available for use by other teams/services within one week of deployment. |

### 4. User Personas

* **Alex (System Administrator):** Alex is responsible for keeping the menu up-to-date. He needs a simple way to add compelling descriptions and assign a quality rating to showcase the best items.
* **Jamie (End Consumer):** Jamie is browsing the menu online, trying to decide what to order. She relies on descriptions and ratings to discover new items and choose a dish she'll enjoy.

### 5. Features & Requirements

#### 5.1. Data Model & API Enhancement

The `Menu` entity shall be extended to store a description and a rating.

* **FR1: Add `description` Field:**
    * A new field named `description` will be added to the `Menu` entity.
    * **Type:** String
    * **Constraints:** Can be null or empty.
* **FR2: Add `rating` Field:**
    * A new field named `rating` will be added to the `Menu` entity.
    * **Type:** Integer
    * **Constraints:**
        * Must be a value from **1 to 5**, inclusive.
        * Cannot be `null`.
        * Cannot be `0`.
* **FR3: API Contract Update:**
    * `GET` requests that return menu items must include the new `description` and `rating` fields in the response body.
    * `POST` (create) and `PUT` (update) requests must accept `description` and `rating` in the request body.
    * The API must enforce the validation constraints for the `rating` field. Invalid requests must fail with a clear client-side error.

#### 5.2. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR1: Performance:** The addition of these two fields should not increase the average API response time by more than 10%.
* **NFR2: Testability:** All new business logic, especially the rating validation rules, must be covered by automated unit and integration tests.
* **NFR3: Documentation:** The API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) must be updated to reflect the changes to the request and response models.

---

### 6. Out of Scope

* **Front-End UI Implementation:** This PRD does not cover the work required to display the new fields on any user-facing application.
* **User-Generated Ratings:** The `rating` field is curated and set by an administrator. This feature does not include a mechanism for end-users to submit their own ratings.
* **Data Migration:** A strategy for populating the `rating` for existing menu items is not covered here and will be handled as a separate task.

---

### 7. Future Considerations

Successfully implementing this feature opens the door for several high-value projects, including:
* A "Sort by Rating" feature on our menus.
* A "Top Rated Items" carousel on the homepage.
* Full-text search functionality that indexes the new `description` field.
